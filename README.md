# SolarCast-Machine-Learning-Project-
PREDICTING SOLAR ENERGY PRODUCTION using Random Forest Regression Our goal is to predict the solar raditaion based on weather data and to also predict the radiation produced using different machine learning techniques. The project employs the Random Forest Regression algorithm, a powerful technique for Predicting continuous numerical values.
